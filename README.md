## **About the Project**
This platform facilitates online code compilation and execution, supporting multiple programming languages and providing real-time feedback. Designed with scalability and performance in mind, the system incorporates asynchronous processing, real-time communication, and efficient resource management.

Key Highlights:
- **Scalability**: Microservices ensure the system can handle increasing user demands.
- **Real-time Interaction**: WebSocket integration allows for instant feedback and interactivity.
- **Multi-language Support**: Docker containers provide isolated environments for safe and efficient execution.

---

## **Tech Stack**
### **Backend**
- **Express.js**: Framework for building RESTful APIs.
- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed language for enhancing maintainability.
- **Fastify**: High-performance framework for managing high request volumes.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for managing dynamic problem sets.
- **Redis**: In-memory data store for caching and message queues.
- **WebSocket**: Real-time communication channel.

### **Containerization**
- **Docker**: Isolated environments for multi-language code execution.

## **Features**
1. **Dynamic Problem Administration**:
   - Manage CRUD operations for programming problems.
   - Include complex test cases and language-specific code stubs.
2. **Advanced Code Execution**:
   - Multi-language support (Java, Python, C++).
   - Efficient handling of Time Limit Exceeded (TLE) scenarios.
   - Strategy and Factory design patterns optimize execution environments.
3. **High-Performance Submission Management**:
   - Handles high volumes of code submissions seamlessly.
   - Asynchronous communication using Redis message queues.
   - Real-time feedback to users through WebSocket.
4. **Fault Tolerance and Scalability**:
   - Scalable microservices architecture ensures reliability under heavy loads.
